# Third-Year-First-Semester
A collection of the assignments that I completed in the first semester of third year.

The assignments were as follows: 

Assignment 1: 
-
  Design a set of protocols so that different hosts may message eachother. 
  Use these protocols to create an application that will:
   - Allow for hosts to send messages to eachother
   - Allow for client-server communication between a client and a server
  * Note, this assignment can be found under the NetworkMessagingProject repo on my account

Assignment 2:
- 
  This assignmnt tasked us to use Wireshark to complete a Wireshark lab by James F. Kurose & Kieth W. Ross.
  As such, there is no upload of this assignment as no coding was required.

Assignment 3:
- https://github.com/ChrispyBacon123/Third-Year-First-Semester/tree/main/Assignment%203
  Design a program that will read in a binary file consisting of virtual memory addresses.
  The program must then map these these addresses to corresponding physical memory addresses -- these were given to be hardcoded in the assignment.
  The program must write the mapped addresses to an output text file. 

Assignment 4:
-
  Create a report in which you compare a First Come First Served scheduing algorithm to a Shortest Job First algorithm. 
  I was provided with a simulation to simiulate a CPU scheduling tasks with a bit of flaire (thanks to an awesome professor).
  In the task, there is a barman who represents the CPU and patrons with drink orders that represent processes with jobs.
